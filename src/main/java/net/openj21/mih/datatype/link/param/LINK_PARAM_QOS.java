 * 0: Maximum number of differentiable classes of service supported.
 * 1: Minimum packet transfer delay for all CoS, the minimum delay over a class

 * 2: Average packet transfer delay for all CoS, the arithmetic mean of the 
 * delay over a class population of interest. (See B.3.4)
 * 3: Maximum packet transfer delay for all CoS, the maximum delay over a
